NAME
     atoi, atoi_l -- convert ASCII string to integer

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

     int
     atoi(const char *str);

     #include &lt;xlocale.h&gt;

     int
     atoi_l(const char *str, locale_t loc);

DESCRIPTION
     The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to
     by str to int representation.

     It is equivalent to:

	   (int)strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10);

     While the atoi() function uses the current locale, the atoi_l() function
     may be passed a locale directly. See xlocale(3) for more information.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The atoi() and atoi_l() functions are thread-safe and async-cancel-safe.

     The atoi() and atoi_l() functions have been deprecated by strtol() and
     strtol_l() and should not be used in new code.

ERRORS
     The function atoi() need not affect the value of errno on an error.

SEE ALSO
     atof(3), atol(3), strtod(3), strtol(3), strtoul(3), xlocale(3)

STANDARDS
     The atoi() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (``POSIX.1''),
     ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (``ISO C90''), and ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (``ISO C99'').

FORK(2) 		    BSD System Calls Manual		       FORK(2)

NAME
     fork -- create a new process

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

     pid_t
     fork(void);

DESCRIPTION
     Fork() causes creation of a new process.  The new process (child process)
     is an exact copy of the calling process (parent process) except for the
     following:

	   o   The child process has a unique process ID.

	   o   The child process has a different parent process ID (i.e., the
	       process ID of the parent process).

	   o   The child process has its own copy of the parent's descriptors.
	       These descriptors reference the same underlying objects, so
	       that, for instance, file pointers in file objects are shared
	       between the child and the parent, so that an lseek(2) on a
	       descriptor in the child process can affect a subsequent read or
	       write by the parent.  This descriptor copying is also used by
	       the shell to establish standard input and output for newly cre-
	       ated processes as well as to set up pipes.

	   o   The child processes resource utilizations are set to 0; see
	       setrlimit(2).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, fork() returns a value of 0 to the child
     process and returns the process ID of the child process to the parent
     process.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned to the parent process, no
     child process is created, and the global variable errno is set to indi-
     cate the error.

ERRORS
     Fork() will fail and no child process will be created if:

     [EAGAIN]		The system-imposed limit on the total number of pro-
			cesses under execution would be exceeded.  This limit
			is configuration-dependent.

     [EAGAIN]		The system-imposed limit MAXUPRC (&lt;sys/param.h&gt;) on
			the total number of processes under execution by a
			single user would be exceeded.

     [ENOMEM]		There is insufficient swap space for the new process.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
     #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

     The include file &lt;sys/types.h&gt; is necessary.

SEE ALSO
     execve(2), sigaction(2), wait(2), compat(5)

HISTORY
     A fork() function call appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T UNIX.

CAVEATS
     There are limits to what you can do in the child process.	To be totally
     safe you should restrict yourself to only executing async-signal safe
     operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called.  All
     APIs, including global data symbols, in any framework or library should
     be assumed to be unsafe after a fork() unless explicitly documented to be
     safe or async-signal safe.  If you need to use these frameworks in the
     child process, you must exec.  In this situation it is reasonable to exec
     yourself.
